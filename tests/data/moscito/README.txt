Torsion test simulations with MOSCITO 4.180. Thanks to D. Paschek for providing the original input files.
Only proper torsions are considered. No other energies / forces are present in the simulations.

Specific tests are:
1. Cubic box of 64 united-atom 1,2-dimethoxy ethane molecules using cos7 + c terms (poe)
2. Cubic box of one Py4OH-NTf2 ion pair using a variety of cos and cosN terms (py4oh)
3. Cubic box of one Py5-NTf2 ion pair using a variety of cos and cosN terms (py5)
4. Cubic box of one Py4OH-NTf2 ion pair (py4oh/)
5. Cubic box of one Py5-NTf2 ion pair (py5/)

For the POE system the original forcefield details and application can be found in: http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp0765345.
For the ionic liquids the forcefield of Ludwig et al. implemented in Dissolve is used.
