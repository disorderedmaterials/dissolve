'Energy / Force 2' System Test
Orthorhombic periodic box containing hexane molecules inc cos3 torsion terms.

Specific inputs are:

one.txt - Energy and forces of a single molecule in a large box.
two.txt - Energy and forces of a two molecules in a large box.
full.txt - Energy and forces of 200 molecules.
torsions.txt - Explicit testing of energy and forces for the Cos3 torsions only (200 molecules).

In all of the above a straight Coulomb sum is used with no truncation.
