'Energy / Force 3' System Test
Test the CosN and CosNC torsion terms as implemented in Dissolve.

Forces calculated with MOSCITO 4.180. Thanks to D. Paschek for providing the original input files.
Only proper torsions are considered. No other forces are present in the simulation.

Specific tests are:

1. Cubic box of 64 united-atom 1,2-dimethoxy ethane molecules using cos7 + c terms (poe/)
2. Cubic box of one Py4OH-NTf2 ion pair using a variety of cos and cosN terms (py4oh/)
3. Cubic box of one Py5-NTf2 ion pair using a variety of cos and cosN terms (py5/)

For the POE system the original forcefield details and application can be found in: http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp0765345.
For the ionic liquids the forcefield of Ludwig et al. implemented in Dissolve is used.
