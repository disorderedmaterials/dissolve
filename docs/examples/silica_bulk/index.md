# Bulk Silica

## Summary

Amorphous silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is found in a variety of places, and is a relatively simple, network forming glass. Here we'll set up a bulk silica simulation in a unit cell of our own design, and which can serve as the basis for other tutorials.

## Preparation

Download the example data file archive `Dissolve-X.Y.Z-ExampleData.zip` or `Dissolve-X.Y.Z-ExampleData.tar.gz` from the [continuous build](https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/releases/tag/continuous) in the releases section on GitHub if you haven't done so already.

> Open the Dissolve GUI
{: .action .action_dissolve}
> Choose **Empty Simulation** from the _Create_ section
{: .step}
> Save As...
{: .action .action_menu}
> Save your own input file under a sensible name in the `silica_bulk` directory of the example data
{: .step}

Alternatively, download the data files listed below and save them to your location of choice.

- Neutron data file: [SiO2_NIMROD.mint01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/develop/examples/silica/data/SiO2_NIMROD.mint01)
