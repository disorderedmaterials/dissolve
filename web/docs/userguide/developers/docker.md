title: Setting up a dev environment using Docker for Windows
description: Instructions for building and running a dissolve Docker image on Windows, including GUI support
---

## Introduction

Outlined below is a step-by-step guide to setting up a development environment on Windows using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) containerisation.

While a Dockerfile for building the package can be found at the top level of the dissolve repository, some manual steps are involved, and this
page aims to guide you through them.

### Basic requirments

You'll need to be running Windows with Docker desktop and the WSL ([Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)) installed.
Check out the dissolve source repository to get access to the code and Dockerfile.

### GUI support with X11 forwarding

For use of the dissolve GUI software, we will need to have installed an X11-forwarding utility on the Windows host system.
This workflow uses the [Xming X Server](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/).

## Setting up the environment

### 1) Build the Docker image

In the dissolve code, open a command prompt of your choice (for instance cmd.exe, powershell, or git bash) and run
```shell
docker build -t dissolve .
```
in order to build the image, where "dissolve" is the image tag.

The image layers are typically cached by Docker so the more time consuming parts of the build process (ranging to a couple of hours) only have to be done on the first build. Subsequent builds are quick.

### 2) Create an X11 client on the host

Open XLaunch, the X11 wizard installed with Xming.

You will be prompted to choose some display settings for viewing the dissolve GUI. It is recommend that the first option (Multiple windows)
is used, since this tends to allow the detached GUI to integrate neatly with your other windows.

Click Next>, allowing the program to start without a client, since this wil automatically detect the container once we run it.

Clicking Next> again, we must allow "Disable access control".

Then configuration is complete. If the XLaunch wizard is successfully running, an XLaunch logo should be visible in the bottom right of the Windows homescreen along with other running applications.

### 3) Run the container and build the dissolve dev environment

Once again in the command prompt, run
```shell
docker run -it -u 0 -e DISPLAY=$HOST_IP_ADDRESS:0 -v $PATH_TO_DISSOLVE_CODE_ON_HOST:/dissolve --name $CONTAINER_NAME dissolve
```

This will run a new instance of the built image in an interactive terminal - you should now see the container's development shell running.

Notice that this command maps the IP address of the host machine to the container (a requirement for X11 forwarding of graphics to take place) as well as mapping the dissolve code into the container. 

Before starting any work, initialise the environment variables using `direnv`:
```shell
direnv allow
echo "$(direnv hook bash)" > /root/.bashrc
```
This will allow the environment to be reloaded automatically on future instances of starting the container (simply execute an interactive terminal with `bash` as the entrypoint - see step 4).

To build the dissolve software using `cmake`, you will need to run the following commands
```shell
cmake --preset GUI-nix
cmake --build build
```
The build products should now be visible in the `/build` directory on both the host and container file systems.

To run all tests from the top level of the repo, run 
```shell
cd build; ctest -j4
```

### 4) Launch the dissolve GUI

Moving over to the interactive terminal of the container, we should see that we are in the container `/dissolve` directory.
Run 
```shell
nixGLIntel ./build/bin/dissolve-gui
``` 
to start the software.

You should now see the dissolve home screen open in a new window.

When the container is closed, the development shell will close, taking the environment dependencies with it.
Therefore, any time returning to work inside the container, run  `docker start $CONTAINER_NAME`, and then
```shell
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_NAME sh -c "direnv allow; bash"
```
which will hook dissolve's dev environment into the new shell.

## Debugging dissolve inside a container

Using a combination of the X server and the GNU gdb debugger we can step through the container-hosted dissolve code in a visual environment.

However, for this Docker setup we are running dissolve's GUI via the `nixGLIntel` wrapper so debugging it is a slightly invovled process.

First, `exec` into the container with `direnv allow; bash` as the entrypoint as you normally would.

It is necessary to build with debug symbols, and this is acomplished using the following commands
```shell
cmake --preset GUI-Debug-nix
cmake --build build
```

Run the dissolve GUI in detached mode to maintain use of the container terminal with
```shell
nohup nixGLIntel ./build/bin/dissolve-gui &
```

Having started the dissolve software, you should see the GUI if the X server is running fine, and finally we can start debugging in gdb
```shell
gdb -tui -p $(pgrep dissolve-gui)
```

We can now use the gdb debugger commands to interrogate the code with GUI support both for the debugger and dissolve itself.
