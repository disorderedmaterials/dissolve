Dissolve is available in packaged / installable form for several common operating systems from the [packages]({{< ref "packages" >}}) page.  Note that these packages focus primarily on providing the GUI version of the code, which can be used for setting up / visualising simulations, as well as running smaller-scale simulations such as the [examples]({{< ref "examples" >}}).

### Windows 10

Dissolve comes as a full installer as well as a plain zip archive (if you don't want to install it, or don't have the privileges to do so). Note that Dissolve is built using Visual Studio, and so you may need to install the [Visual C++ runtime libraries](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

### Mac OSX

A disk image is available for recent versions of OSX.

### Linux

Dissolve is packaged in an AppImage, which should be suitable for most distributions. Note that the AppImage must be made executable in order to use it! We do not currently provide rpm or deb packages.
