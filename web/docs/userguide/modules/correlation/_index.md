title: Correlation Modules
description: Obtain real- and reciprocal-space structural correlation functions
---
The correlation modules are responsible for calculating full sets of atomic partials from source a configuration (or configurations) in real or reciprocal space. Because the unweighted atomic partials in real and reciprocal space are quite closely related, as are their weighted counterparts, the modules in this category typically depend on each other's data.
