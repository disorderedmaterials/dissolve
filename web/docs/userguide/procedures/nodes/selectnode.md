## Overview

The `Select` node assembles a list of [sites]({{< ref "siteblock" >}}) from a species, and which can then be iterated over and reference by other nodes (e.g. the `Calculate*` nodes).

## Description

The `Select` node assembles a list of coordinates (and axes, if present) for one or more defined sites. The mechanism of selection can be controlled to provide exclusions with other sites (e.g. based on the parent molecule containing the site) or select only sites within a given distance of another reference point. Iteration over the sites is performed via the `ForEach` branch.

When nesting `Select` nodes in analysis routines, the selection of sites can be carefully controlled in order to avoid unwanted groups of selected nodes. For instance, the `SameMoleculeAsSite` keyword allows another `Select` node to be reference, and which will force the current `Select` node to only select a site if it is present in the same molecule as the other site.

## Branching

The hidden `ForEach` keyword / branch is executed for each site selected by the node, and may contain any other analysis-style nodes, including other `Select` nodes.

## Available Parameters

The following parameters are exported by the node:

|Parameter|Description|
|:--------|-----------|
|`nSelected`|The number of sites currently selected by the node|

## Options

### Sites

|Keyword|Arguments|Default|Description|
|:------|:--:|:-----:|-----------|
|`Site`|`name`<br/>`[name...]`|--|A list of named sites to select.|

### Control

|Keyword|Arguments|Default|Description|
|:------|:--:|:-----:|-----------|
|`SameMoleculeAsSite`|`name`|--|Request that selected sites come from the molecule containing the current site in the named `Select` node.|
|`ExcludeSameMolecule`|`name`<br/>`[name...]`|--|Exclude sites from the selection if they are present in the same molecule as the current site in any of the named `SelectNode`s.|
|`ExcludeSameSite`|`name`<br/>`[name...]`|--|Exclude sites from the selection if they are the current site in any of the named `SelectNode`s.|
|`ReferenceSite`|{{< node "Select" >}}|--|Site from the named `Select` node to be used as a reference point when determining inclusions / exclusions.|
|`InclusiveRange`|`min`<br/>`max`|--|Distance range from `ReferenceSite` within which sites are selected.|
