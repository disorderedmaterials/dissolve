title: What Constitutes a Good Fit?
description: Why does my simulation not agree with the experimental data?
---

In the following sections we will discuss a few common "mismatches" between simulation and experiment, the likely causes behind them, and some possible solutions. For help with these or any other problems you should approach your instrument contact.



Close fit, but not exact
General agreemnet is bad over whole Q range for all samples
Agreement is good for some samples, but not for others.
Higher-Q Peaks Not Matching
Lower Q peaks not matching
XXX TODO



I've tried adjusting bond lengths and angles, but still can't get anywhere!
