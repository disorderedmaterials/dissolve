## Overview

Dissolve comes with a number of built-in forcefields that cover a variety of common (and not so common) systems, enabling simulations to be set up quickly and easily. If your system isn't covered by one of the built-in forcefields, get in touch with the team and we'll see what we can do.

The following sections detail the various interaction potential forms available within Dissolve, and give implementation details of specific forcefields.
