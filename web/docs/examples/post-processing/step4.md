Let's create our correlation layer:

{{< action type="menu" text="Layer &#8680; Create &#8680; Correlations &#8680; RDF and Neutron S(Q)" />}}

Recall that our {{< module "ImportTrajectory" >}} module is running every iteration, so our correlation calculation layer needs to do the same:

{{< action type="tabs" >}}Go to the {{< gui-tab type="layer" text="RDF and Neutron S(Q)" >}} layer tab{{< /action >}}
{{< action type="edit" >}}Change the frequency in the _Layer Control_ at the top-left of the tab from `5` to `1`{{< /action >}}

Let's do a quick, single iteration to make sure everything is working as expected:

{{< action type="key" >}}Ctrl-1{{< /action >}}

What will have happened in this iteration is that a single frame will have been read in from the trajectory into the configuration and, if we've got everything else set up correctly, from which some sensible-looking radial distribution functions and (neutron-weighted) structure factors will have been calculated.  The latter total F(Q) should look like this:
