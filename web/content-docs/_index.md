## Overview

**Structure Refinement for Scattering Data**

Dissolve is a classical simulation code intended to help in analysing experimental scattering (diffraction) measurements through generating representative atomic configurations consistent with supplied reference data. Its primary use is for disordered systems such as those comprised of (or containing) liquids and glasses, but it can be applied to much more complex systems. See [What is Dissolve?]({{< ref "whatisdissolve" >}}}}) for more information.

An initial publication describing Dissolve and proving consistency with existing methodology is available here:
