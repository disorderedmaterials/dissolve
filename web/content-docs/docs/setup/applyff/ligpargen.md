An extremely useful tool to obtain forcefield parameters based on OPLS-AA for a multitude of systems is the [LigParGen service](http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/) provided by the Jorgensen group at Yale. This can, in principle, provide you with a full forcefield (including charges) which can be imported into Dissolve. See the information on [importing species]({{< ref "importing" >}}) for more information on how this process works.
