description: On Dissolve's release cycle planning

## Introduction

### Purpose
This document defines the versioning and release cycle intended for the Dissolve project.

### Scope
This document describes and defines the release cycle and versioning for the Dissolve project in more detail, suitable for users, contributors, and developers.

## Overview

Dissolve is a scientific code with a well-defined underlying framework (which is likely to change slowly) upon which specific functionality is added in a [modular manner](../overviews/modules). The development team undertake sequential two week sprints as a general practice, with each minor version increment (e.g. `0.7` to `0.8`) loosely comprising of four sprints, although this is subject to change by external factors.

Development priorities for each incremental version will be decided by the [project management committee](/docs/governance/project).
