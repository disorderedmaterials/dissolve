title: Release Cycle
description: On Dissolve's release cycle planning
---

## Introduction

### Purpose
This document defines the versioning and release cycle intended for the Dissolve project.

### Scope
This document describes and defines the release cycle and versioning for the Dissolve project in more detail, suitable for users, contributors, and developers.

## Overview

Dissolve is a scientific code with a well-defined underlying framework (which is likely to change slowly) upon which specific functionality is added in a [modular manner]({{< ref "moduledev" >}}). Each minor version increment (e.g. `0.7` to `0.8`) typically marks the introduction of a significant new feature or capability, with development priorities for each incremental version  decided by the [project management committee]({{< ref "pmc" >}}). Critical bugfixes and other usability issues are introduced as patched versions to minor releases (e.g. `0.8.1`, `0.8.2`).
