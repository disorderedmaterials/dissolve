title: Step 1 - Create a Water Species
weight: 1
---


Our first task is to create our water molecule species and give it a suitable forcefield description.

There are several ways to get atomic coordinates in to Dissolve, but since water is a simple molecule in this example we'll draw the molecule in the GUI itself.

We'll then set up the isotopologues we need to enable us to calculate the same weighted structure factors as those measured experimentally on the instrument.
