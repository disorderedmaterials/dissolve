title: Step 9 - Compare Data
---


Viewing the output of modules in their own tabs is convenient enough, but if we want to compare data from different sources (or different restart points) on the same plot we need to use a workspace. A workspace is an empty tab to which you can add various "gizmos" to do graphing and further data analysis. Note that the contents of workspaces are not saved to the [main input file](../../userguide/inputfile) - they are stored in the [GUI state file](../../userguide/outputfiles/state.md).

In the next two sections we'll compare both the centre-of-geometry RDF and the axis angle map between the reference and refined simulations.
