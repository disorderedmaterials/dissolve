## Overview

The `CalculateDistance` node calculates the distance, in Angstroms, between two provided sites $i$ and $j$, which are referenced from [`Select`]({{< ref "selectnode" >}}) nodes.

## Description

`CalculateDistance` is one of several calculation nodes that determine and store a numerical result, ready for retrieval and use by other nodes in a procedure.

`CalculateDistance` determines the distance $i$-$j$ between the selected sites $i$ and $j$, obeying the minimum image convention if the encompassing box is periodic. The resulting value is measured in Angstroms.
