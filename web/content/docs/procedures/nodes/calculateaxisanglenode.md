## Overview

The `CalculateAxisAngle` node calculates the angle, in degrees, between specific axes on two sites $i$ and $j$, which are referenced from [`Select`]({{< ref "selectnode" >}}) nodes.

## Description

`CalculateAxisAngle` is one of several calculation nodes that determine and store a numerical result, ready for retrieval and use by other nodes in a procedure.

`CalculateAxisAngle` determines the angle formed between specific axes on two oriented sites $i$ and $j$, mapping the origins of both axes to {0,0,0}. The resulting value is measured in degrees.
