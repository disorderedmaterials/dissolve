## Overview

The `OperateNormalise` node performs a division operation on data supplied to it, using the result of a numerical expression as the divisor.

## Description

In the "Operate" context all `Operate*` nodes are passed data of some dimensionality (e.g. from one of the `Process*` nodes) which is then subjected to some kind of mathematical operation.

The `OperateNormalise` node calculates the sum (or absolute sum) of the supplied data, and divides all values by the sum in order to give the normalised data whose sum equals 1.0. The data is then multiplied by the supplied value (which also defaults to 1.0) to give a sum other than 1.0. The target data may be of any dimensionality.
