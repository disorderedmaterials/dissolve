{{< warn text="You may notice a small 'upturn' in the calculated F(Q) for the D<sub>2</sub>O sample that does not match experiment. This is caused by subtle density fluctuations in the configuration that are accentuated by the deuteration of the water, and will disappear slowly over time. You can safely proceed with the example." >}}

 

Why does my simulation not agree with the experimiental data?

 

It's important to always bear in mind that there is no readily applicable, exact methodology that can be applied to understand atomic structure from total scattering data. Reproducing the intricacies of even simple real-world sytems is challenging, and the more complex the real-world system being measured is, the more prone to variance and error the actual samples are. Nevertheless, there are a handful of common possibilities worth considering when trying to understand observed differences between simulated structure factors and the target experimental data. The sections that follow are by no means exhaustive - some have concrete advice to resolve the discussed differences, while others are more "thoughtful" in their approach. Always remember that many systems will require detailed  investigation and fine-tuning, and you should liaise with those responsible for the instruments and software to try and resolve any discrepancies. 

 

Close fit, but not exact
General agreemnet is bad over whole Q range for all samples
Agreement is good for some samples, but not for others.
Higher-Q Peaks Not Matching
Lower Q peaks not matching
XXX TODO
