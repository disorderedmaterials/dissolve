description: Defining procedures to create, analyse, and edit

## Overview

Procedures are used within Dissolve to allow user-defined tasks to be created and used for various jobs - e.g. generating the contents for a configuration, performing a specific analysis etc. They are simple sequences of steps or "nodes" that are run when required, with each node having a focussed and specific purpose. Combined, the actions of these simplistic nodes can generate and manipulate complex coordinate ensembles, and analyse complicated structural patterns. Writing a procedure doesn't quite equate to coding in the traditional sense, but does bear some resemblance to a simplistic LabView-style project.
