title: 8. Procedures
description: Defining procedures to create, analyse, and edit
---

## Overview

Procedures are used within Dissolve to allow user-defined tasks to be created and used for various jobs - e.g. generating the contents for a configuration, performing a specific analysis etc. They are simple sequences of steps or "nodes" that are run when required, with each node having a focussed and specific purpose. Combined, the actions of these simplistic nodes can generate and manipulate complex coordinate ensembles, and analyse complicated structural patterns.

## Nodes

A procedure is made up of one or more "nodes", each of which performs a specific task on or with some defined objects in a simulation (e.g. species or configuration boxes), generates data from the simulation, or manipulates data generated by other nodes.

### Control Options

Each node has a number of control keywords that define how the node will act.

### Value Expressions

For flexibility, node options that require numerical values understand mathematical expressions rather than just plain integers or floating-point values. They can also reference parameters from other nodes, such as those defined in a [`ParametersNode`]({{< ref "parametersnode" >}}).
