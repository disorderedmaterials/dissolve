Dissolve uses Angstroms (&#8491;) for distance, degrees (&deg;) for angles, and kJ/mol for energies.

All of Dissolve's input files expect these units to be used, and all of Dissolve's output is given in these units.

External datafiles from other codes, e.g. structure files containing atomic coordinates, that are known to Dissolve and which use units other than these will be converted accordingly.
