Having a ready set of forcefields that cover a variety of common systems is obviously useful, so Dissolve has a number of forcefields built-in and ready to use on your species. These are typically added on request as and when they are required for specific cases. If you have a particular forcefield in mind that you would like to see added to Dissolve, you could consider formatting the interaction parameters into a form that makes it [easy for the development team to include]({{< ref "implementing" >}}). Even if you're not comfortable with coding, reformatting the parameters is a big step and extremely helpful! Open a question [on the forum](https://forum.projectdissolve.com) if you want to talk about specifics.

For a full list of all the current built-in forcefields, see the [Forcefields]({{< ref "ff" >}}) section.
