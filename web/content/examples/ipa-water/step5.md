Now that we have added our analysis sites, we can add our processing layers.

There is an abundance of analysis that can be done on this system using Dissolve. In this tutorial we will start by setting up our RDF and neutron-weighted structure factors layer, then we will add some site-based RDF and SDF analysis.

It would be worth considering what further analysis layers could be included to inform us on the hydrogen bonding within the system.
