We need to set up a site `COM-IPA` representing the centre-of-mass of the IPA molecule:

{{< action type="tabs" >}}Open the {{< gui-tab text="IPA" type="Species" >}} and go to the **Analysis Sites** section {{< /action >}}
{{< action type="mouse" text="In the species viewer to the right, click-drag with the left mouse button and draw a box around all of the atoms in the IPA molecule to select them." />}}
{{< action type="mouse" >}}Click the {{< gui-button text="Origin" >}} button in the toolbar of the viewer to set the currently-selected atoms as defining the origin{{< /action >}}
{{< step text="Select the **Weight by mass** option in the **Origin Atom(s)** section" />}}
{{< action type="edit" text="Double-click on the new site in the list and change its name to COM-IPA" />}}

We also need to set up `COM-w` representing the centre-of-mass of the water molecule, which can be achieved with a very similar process.
