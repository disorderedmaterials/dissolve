Now that the analysis processing layer is prepared, we need to run it for a while in order to get some good statistics on our quantities.
A good 1000 iterations is needed to get the statistics for the 3D map, so let's ask Dissolve to run for a set number of steps:

{{< action type="menu" text="Simulation &#8680; Run For..." />}}
{{< action type="edit">}}Enter 1000 and click {{< gui-button text="OK" >}}{{< /action >}}

Dissolve will now iterate for 1000 iterations and stop - you can see the estimated time (ETA) to complete these 1000 steps in the status bar at the bottom of the main window.

### Snapshot the Current Data

Let's save the current data now, as it represents our reference point against which we'll compare things later on:

{{< action type="menu" text="File &#8680; Save Restart Point..." />}}
{{< action type="edit">}}Change the filename to reference.restart and click {{< gui-button text="Save" >}}{{< /action >}}

You might also find it useful to copy images of the graphs here to help with comparison later on - right-click on an empty part of the graph and select _Copy to clipboard_ - or you can right-click on a particular curve and save the data directly in order to plot it in some other external software.

### Clear the Current Data

Since we're about to refine our simulation against experimental data and re-run the analysis, we don't want to retain any of the currently-calculated quantities. We can request that Dissolve clear all of the data generated by modules and reset the simulation back to an "empty" state. Critically, the current contents of any configurations will remain untouched (i.e. our equilibrated box will remain in its present state, so we can proceed directly on with the simulation). It will also reset the iteration counter to zero.

### Time to get rid of that data...

{{< action type="menu" text="Simulation &#8680; Clear Module Data" />}} {{< step >}}Accept the consequences, and click {{< gui-button text="OK" >}}{{< /step >}}

### Turn off the Analysis Layers

We need to refine the simulation before we calculate our properties again, so we need to temporarily turn off our analysis layers:
{{< action type="tabs">}}Go to the {{< gui-tab type="layer" text="Analysis" >}} layer{{< /action >}}
{{< step text="Disable the layers by clicking the   button in *Layer Control* at the top-left of the tab so it displays  " />}}

{{< button pos="left" text="Previous Step" path="step5c/">}} {{< button pos="right" text="Next Step" path="step7/">}}
