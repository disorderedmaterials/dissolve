type: docs

Presuming that your molecule wasn't too exotic and LigParGen managed to do its thing you'll be presented with a page containing a lot of download options for the generated data.  All Dissolve needs is the `XML` data containing the forcefield terms (found under the _OpenMM_ section) and the 3D `XYZ` coordinates of the target molecule (found under the _Tinker_ section). Download both of those individually, or alternatively grab the `ZIP` file which contains all of the available data files.
