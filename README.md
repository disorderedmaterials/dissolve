**Dissolve** is a simulation tool for the interrogation of neutron scattering data, typically total neutron scattering data. It builds on the techniques established in the Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) method by Soper.

**Dissolve** is in heavy ongoing development, and as such the code here is rather volatile. The [`develop`](https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/tree/develop) branch should always contain a compilable, working version however.

Feel free to try **Dissolve** out if you wish, but do not expect miracles or a super-easy ride at present!

Documentation is a work in progress, and is available at [https://trisyoungs.github.io/dissolve](https://trisyoungs.github.io/dissolve).
