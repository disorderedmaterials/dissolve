## Overview

**Dissolve** is a simulation tool for the interrogation of neutron scattering data, typically total neutron scattering data. It builds on the techniques established in the Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) method by Soper.

The basic algorithms used in both Dissolve and EPSR, and the intent of Dissolve, is described in "[Dissolve: next generation software for the interrogation of total scattering data by empirical potential generation](https://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2019.1651918)", _Mol. Phys._ **117**, 3464-3477 ([10.1080/00268976.2019.1651918](https://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2019.1651918))
